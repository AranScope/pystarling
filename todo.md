# Todo

- Make sure optional types are made to be named arguments in Starling object
    - Check the entity type definitions to ensure this
- Change return type docstring for all functions with "the http request promise"
- annotate types
- Ensure that any tests without assert at the end check for no exceptions


savingsGoals.js
- the name of the new contact :
- createSavingsGoal should probably have url goal_id paramter in the body for consistency
- addMoneyToSavingsGoal currency not in jsdoc

payment.js
- Keep saying transaction instead of payment


- abstract out defaults etc. into a separate class, so it's cleaner
